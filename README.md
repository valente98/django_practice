# More View Practice

The goal of this assignment is to get more practice with views.

The assignment is based on https://github.com/BaseCampCoding/starting-js.

You should write a url+view+template for each function in starting-js.

The inputs to your views should be provided through `GET` parameters.

The outputs should be displayed to the user through the template.

`add` has been done for you as an example.
